## Workspace

This folder contains your Rust-101 workspace. I suggest you copy this
folder somewhere else. Try `cargo build` in that new folder to check that compiling your workspace succeeds.
(You can also execute it with `cargo run`, but you'll need to do some work before this will succeed.)
See the [main tutorial](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html) for more details.

Please do *not* edit this folder inside a `git clone` of Rust-101. The files in here are auto-generated.
You should edit the files in `src/` in the repository root instead.
