// Welcome to Rust-101
// ===================
//
// This is Rust-101, a small tutorial to the [Rust language](http://www.rust-lang.org/).
// This is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to
// *really* learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during
// the course. These documents mainly serve as a guide to the teacher, reminding me
// what to explain in which order, and making sure I have sample code for all topics
// I plan to cover. They may also be helpful as an offline resource, but you're on your
// own then.

// The actual course is in the partXX.rs files. I suggest you get started with
// [the first part](part00.html), or jump directly to where you left off:

// * [Part 00](part00.html)
// * [Part 01](part01.html)
mod part00;
mod part01;

// To actually run the code after filling in the blanks, simply edit the `main`
// function below.

fn main() {
    part00::part_main();
}
