// Rust-101, Part 00
// =================

// As a starter, we want to write a function that computes the minimum of a list.
// First, we need to get a list. For now, let's just hard-code some sample list.
// Later, we will ask the user to input a list.
// 
// Observe how in Rust, the function type comes *after* the arguments (which, in
// this case, the function does not have). `Vec<i32>` is the type of a growable list
// of (signed, 32-bit) integers.

pub fn read_vec() -> Vec<i32> {
    vec![0,1,2,3,4]
}


pub fn part_main() {
    
}
